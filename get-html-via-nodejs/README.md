# get-html-via-nodejs

## Can do what?
request special url, and response to your client.

## Usage
npm install 
node index.js


## PS
* If you use get-html-via-nodejs to access other site, the url must look like: `http://localhost:57777/${encodeURIComponent("http://your.site.url/path/params")}`; 
* If you would like to use forever or pm2, that's all right, node service will restart when it was crashed.

# Enjoy it!
